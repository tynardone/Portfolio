# About Me

Hello! I'm Tyler Nardone, a Data Scientist with a BS in Physics and Biology who started his career in natural resources and ecology.

Although I was accepted into a quantitative ecology PhD program, circumstances led me to forge a different path. This turn of events sparked my self-driven journey into the realms of data science. I've since developed robust skills in programming with Python and SQL, leveraging tools like Tableau, and diving deep into computer science, data analysis, and machine learning.

Through my self-education, I've transitioned my analytical skills from ecological data to broader data science applications. My portfolio showcases projects that span from environmental data analysis to more extensive machine learning projects that predict complex patterns and outcomes in various datasets.

As I continue to grow professionally, I remain committed to learning and adapting to new challenges. My goal is to blend my diverse background with my technical skills to provide unique perspectives and data-driven solutions in any project I tackle.

Please explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out through [Contact Information or Link to Contact Page] if you see a potential for collaboration or wish to discuss opportunities. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
