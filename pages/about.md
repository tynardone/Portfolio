# About Me

Hello! I'm Tyler Nardone, a Data Scientist with a BS in Physics and Biology who started his career in natural resources and ecology. I've since developed robust skills in programming with Python and SQL, leveraging tools like Tableau, and diving deep into computer science, data analysis, and machine learning.

Through my self-education, I've transitioned my analytical skills from ecological data to broader data science applications. As I continue to grow professionally, I remain committed to learning and adapting to new challenges. My goal is to blend my diverse background with my technical skills to provide unique perspectives and data-driven solutions in any project I tackle.

Please explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out through [Contact Information or Link to Contact Page] if you see a potential for collaboration or wish to discuss opportunities. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
